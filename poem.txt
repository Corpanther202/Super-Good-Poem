Life is like a balloon,
Colorful,
Wonderful,
flowy,
wavy
stay wavy.

Floating through the breeze,
Waving underneath the bright blue hue with ease.
stay wavy.


But sometimes the struggle is real,
too real its almost too scary
The thought of being popped can bring fear.
POP!
stay wavy.

Childlike and free the balloon soars,
